## Basic mask-detector w/ml5js

This repository uses **ml5.js** library and **p5.js** library for testing a simple model made with
**TeachableMachine**. This model was trained for recognise the face of a person with the
mouth and nose covered by a mask.

The model needs some kind of readjustments and the web some frontend to look a *bit better*.

You can try ml5.js [here](https://ml5js.org/)
